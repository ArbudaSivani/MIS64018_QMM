#Objective function is to maximize 
#The product can be made in three sizes - large, medium and small. Total net profit is denoted by "Z". Maximize Z = 420(P1L+P2L+P3L) + 360(P1M+P2M+P3M) + 300(P1S+P2S+P3S). The objective function is defined as:
f.obj <- c(420,360,300,
           420,360,300,
           420,360,300)
